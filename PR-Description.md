# Fix Windows 11 Canary Build Theme Detection (Issue #700)

This pull request addresses the issue with color auto setting being broken on Windows 11 Canary builds.

## Changes

### Enhanced Windows Version Detection
- Added detection for Windows 11 Insider channels (Canary, Dev, Beta, Release Preview)
- Added a new `IsWindows11CanaryOrDev()` helper function
- Improved version detection by checking the `FlightRing` registry value

### Improved Theme Color Detection
- Added special handling for Windows 11 Canary and Dev builds
- Implemented fallback mechanisms using system colors when theme APIs fail
- Added more robust error checking for theme color retrieval

## Testing
The fix has been tested on:
- Windows 11 Canary Build 26100
- Windows 11 Dev Build 26085

All builds now correctly detect and apply theme colors in both light and dark modes.
